    <h3>My Plan</h3>
    <p>
        It was a Tuesday morning, and i had plan to spend my valentine with my dearly beloved. <i>I know what you must be thinking</i>, <strong>it was actually with my family members</strong> which includes my parents and siblings. <br>
        I received a mail from EDSA to come over to the government house for the lauching ceremony which also doubles as the orientation day. As much as I was excited about my earlier planned outing, I was more excited to attend the launching of the long awaited programme.
    </p>
    <p>
        in great excitment, <i><strong>I hopped on a taxi and straight to the government house. It was at the venue of the event I realised that i had not eating my breakfast.</strong></i>
